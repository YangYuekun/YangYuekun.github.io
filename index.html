        <p>I am passionate about learning and solving problems efficiently and effectively. I enjoy building solutions that have a lasting impact. Having worked as a Registered Nurse for 6+ years, I am able to bring solid communication skills and know how to work well in a team environment, yet also take initiative in leading when necessary. As proven in my timeline, I am able to learn quickly new skills in a field where I have found my true passion producing quality software that is simple to understand, easily testable, and highly scaleable.</p>
